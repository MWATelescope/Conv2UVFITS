FIELDNAME testfield
TELESCOPE MWA   # telescope name like MWA, MOST, ATCA etc
N_SCANS   4     # number of scans (time instants) in correlation products
N_INPUTS  64    # number of inputs into the correlation products
N_CHANS   32   # number of channels in spectrum
CORRTYPE  S     # correlation type to use. 'C'(cross), 'B'(both), or 'A'(auto)
INT_TIME  5.0   # integration time of scan in seconds
FREQCENT  150.0 # observing center freq in MHz
BANDWIDTH 1.28  # total bandwidth in MHz
HA_HRS    -1.0  # the HA at the *start* of the scan. (hours)
RA_HRS    0.0   # the RA of the desired phase centre (hours)
DEC_DEGS  -30.0 # the DEC of the desired phase centre (degs)
